# Simple_Engine
This project is a chess engine written in C that focuses on code simplicity rather than performance. I wrote it to have a definitive objective to work towards as I practice my C programming skills. It uses an evaluation function based on basic piece square tables and how many pieces each side has.

# Dependencies
The project requires SDL2 and SDL_image in order to be built.

# Releases
As of right now, the only release is for windows.
